Here are three steps to get you started creating a Streamlit app:\n\nStep 1: Install Streamlit\n- Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.\n- Open the terminal or command prompt.\n- Install Streamlit by running the following command: `pip install streamlit`\n\nStep 2: Create a Python script for your app\n- Create a new Python file (.py) using your preferred code editor.\n- Import the Streamlit module using `import streamlit as st`.\n- Start building your app by writing Python code to define the layout and functionality.\n\nStep 3: Run the app\n- Save the Python script.\n- Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the script is saved.\n- Run the app by executing the command: `streamlit run script_name.py` (replace \"script_name\" with the actual name of your Python script).\n- A local server will be started, and you can view your app in your web browser at the specified local address (usually http://localhost:8501).\n\nThese steps will help you get started with creating a basic Streamlit app. From there, you can explore the Streamlit documentation and add more features and functionality to your app as needed.",
